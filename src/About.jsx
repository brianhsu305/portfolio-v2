				ABOUT
			</h1>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				I am a newly graduate with <span className='font-bold text-secondary'>Bachelor of Computer Science</span> degree from <span className="text-secondary"> Simon Fraser University</span>. I always have been interested in technology
				since I was a kid, which lead to my previous job experience at Best Buy and Canada Computers so I could get in touch with more trending technologies.
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				<span className='font-bold text-secondary'>Problem solving</span> is what inspires me to become a software developer. Solving a coding problem itâ€™s like solving a puzzle, except it is
				with alphabets and numbers.{' '}
			</p>
			<p className='mb-4'>
				Currently, I am looking to start my professional software developer career to apply my skills in real world and to make an impact. Feel free to contact me if you like my portfolio!
