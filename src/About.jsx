				I am a newly graduate with <span className="font-bold text-pink-300">Bachelor of Computer Science degree from Simon Fraser University</span>. I always have been interested in technology since I was a kid, which lead to my previous
				job experience at Best Buy and Canada Computers so I could get in touch with more trending technologies.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p><span className="font-bold text-pink-300">Problem solving</span> is what inspires me to become a software developer. Solving a coding problem itâ€™s like solving a puzzle, except it is with alphabets and numbers. </p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Currently, I am looking to start my professional software developer career to apply my skills in real world and to make an impact. Feel free to contact me if you like my portfolio!
