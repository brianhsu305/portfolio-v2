				ABOUT
			</h1>
			<p className='text-secondary'>
				I am a newly graduate with <span className='font-bold text-primary'>Bachelor of Computer Science degree from Simon Fraser University</span>. I always have been interested in technology
				since I was a kid, which lead to my previous job experience at Best Buy and Canada Computers so I could get in touch with more trending technologies.
			</p>
			<p className='text-secondary'>
				<span className='font-bold text-primary'>Problem solving</span> is what inspires me to become a software developer. Solving a coding problem itâ€™s like solving a puzzle, except it is
				with alphabets and numbers.{' '}
			</p>
			<p className='text-secondary'>
				Currently, I am looking to start my professional software developer career to apply my skills in real world and to make an impact. Feel free to contact me if you like my portfolio!
